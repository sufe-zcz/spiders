but, instinct guiding    slightest indication, captain nemo would discover  new pass.   never mistaken   saw  thin threads  bluish water trickling along  ice-fields;     doubt    already ventured   midst   antarctic seas before.   16th  march, however,  ice-fields absolutely blocked  road.     iceberg itself,  yet,  vast fields cemented   cold.   obstacle could  stop captain nemo:  hurled     frightful violence.  nautilus entered  brittle mass like  wedge,  split   frightful crackings.    battering ram   ancients hurled  infinite strength.  ice, thrown high   air, fell like hail around us.    power  impulsion  apparatus made  canal  itself;  times carried away    impetus,  lodged   ice-field, crushing    weight,  sometimes buried beneath it, dividing    simple pitching movement, producing large rents  it. violent gales assailed us   time, accompanied  thick fogs,  which,  one end   platform   other,  could see nothing.  wind blew sharply   parts   compass,   snow lay   hard heaps     break   blows   pickaxe.  temperature  always  5@  zero;

"i believe you! let us go ahead!    obstacles  us! let us smash  iceberg! let us blow  up; and,   resists, let us give  nautilus wings  fly  it!"/n"over it, sir!" said captain nemo, quietly; "no,   it,   it!"/n"under it!"  exclaimed,  sudden idea   captain's projects flashing upon  mind.  understood;  wonderful qualities   nautilus  going  serve us   superhuman enterprise./n"i see   beginning  understand one another, sir," said  captain, half smiling.
